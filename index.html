<h1>Finally</h1>

<p>Same deal as before:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You may use any resources except other people. Old assignments are fine. Google is fine.</li>
  <li>You <strong>may not</strong> copy and paste code off the internet or use tools that
    lookup and generate code for you. Write it yourself, in your own way.</li>
  <li>Get your browser tools up, you're going to need them.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the directory with this <code>index.html</code> file are two subdirectories: <code>server</code> and <code>client</code>.</p>

<p>Each has a pre-made <code>package.json</code> with everything set up. Open a shell in each subdirectory and do:</p>

<pre>npm install</pre>

<p>Alternatively, you could move an old node_modules into each. Here is what must be present in each:</p>
<ul>
  <li>server: express sqlite sqlite3 cors</li>
  <li>client: the node_modules from A11 (create-react-app + axios)</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>server.js</code> file already has all the needed module imports and configuration, you
  only have to add routes.</p>

<p>Start up the server with:</p>

<pre>node (or nodemon) server.js</pre>

<p>And the react client with:</p>

<pre>npm run start</pre>

<p>That should automatically open a new tab with the app and instructions.
  If it doesn't: <a target="_blank" href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a></p>
